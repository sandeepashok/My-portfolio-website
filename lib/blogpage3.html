                <strong>What is Netlify?</strong> <br>
                <a class="blog-link" href="https://app.netlify.com/" target=_blank>Netlify</a> is a web developer platform that multiplies productivity. It enables a 10x faster path to much more performant, secure, and scalable websites and apps. <br> <br>
               <strong> Setting up Netlify:</strong><br>
               If you are not an existing user go to sign up log in with an Email Id or Github complete the authentication you will get into Netlify. once you are logged in, you can see a "New project" button. <br><br>
               <strong>Adding project and linking GitHub:</strong><br>
               Click on add new project button, this gives a pop-up showing "Be sure to push your repository to GitHub" (If you've logged in through Email Id be sure to link GitHub account to Netlify.) After you get the pop-up click on GitHub button that will be displayed on the screen you are done with the linking process. <br><br>
               <strong>Authorization of Netlify and selecting of Repository:</strong><br>
               Now we have to let Netlify and GitHub to interact with each other by clicking on "Authorize application" Button. If you want to know more about permission request and more information, you can read on Git provider permissions. Now here's how to select repository, since you're connected with GitHub, you can see the list of Git repositories to choose, now select the repository you like to deploy from the list. <br><br>
               <strong>Configuration and Touch-ups:</strong><br>
               Now you can configure the user options as you wish then click on "Deploy" button. Now you can take a chill-pill and let Netlify take care of the rest. It takes less than a minute to build and deploy your site. whohoo! your site is online. Now go to "Overview", you can see the URl of your newly published site. Netlify auto-generates an username and url for your site which you can change by clicking "Change site name". Now you own a Website and a Domain name. How cool is that?! <br>
